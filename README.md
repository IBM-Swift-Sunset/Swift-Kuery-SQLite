## Summary
[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) plugin for the [Swift-Kuery](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-Kuery) framework. It enables you to use Swift-Kuery to manipulate data in an SQLite database.

## SQLite installation

To use Swift-Kuery-SQLite you must install SQLite.

### macOS

You can install SQLite with Homebrew:

```
$ brew install sqlite
```

Or, if you prefer MacPorts, you can use that too, though note that you need to symlink a file into the place that Homebrew installs it:

```
$ port install sqlite3
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/opt/sqlite/include
$ ln -s /opt/local/include/sqlite3.h /usr/local/opt/sqlite/include/
```

### Linux
```
$ sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```

## Using Swift-Kuery-SQLite

First create an instance of `Swift-Kuery-SQLite` by calling:

```swift
let db = SQLiteConnection(filename: "myDB.db")
```

To establish a connection call:

```swift
db.connect(onCompletion: (QueryError?) -> ())
```

You now have a connection that can be used to execute SQL queries created using Swift-Kuery. View the [Kuery](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Swift-Kuery) documentation for more information, or see the [Database Connectivity with Kuery](https://nocturnalsolutions.gitbooks.io/kitura-book/content/5-kuery.html) chapter of the *[Kitura Until Dawn](https://www.gitbook.com/book/nocturnalsolutions/kitura-book)* guidebook/tutorial.
